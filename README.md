# ParkingWebApp
Code for the web application of the UMBC IEEE Parking Project

This branch contains the files for an extremely simplistic Web Application. The tutorial for this Web App as well as instructions for how to set up the application with the Google App Engine can be found in a tutorial from Real Python, linked below. This example does not demonstrate any of the dynamic capabilities that the final product for this project needs, but it is so simplistic that it is a good first introduction to the App Engine.
