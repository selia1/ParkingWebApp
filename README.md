# ParkingWebApp
Code for the web application of the UMBC IEEE Parking Project

This branch contains the files for a dynamic Web Application example. The tutorial for this Web App as well as instructions for how to set up the application with the Google App Engine can be found in a tutorial from Real Python, linked below. This example does demonstrate dynamic components similar to what will be needed in the final product of this project, however the final product will requier other features not included in this example.
